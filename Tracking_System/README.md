TRACKING SYSTEM

Tracking system is a method used to track the detection, reporting, and resolution when a system has some type of problem. A ticket is the
result of a user submitting a help request through a tracking system, and it contains all the details of the problem the user is facing 
with a network or a system.

The reason for me to select this project to develop is quite realistic. Back in India, whenever I had any problem with the internet 
connection, I had to call the technician by phone. After many phone calls, the technician would come and resolve the issue. This didn’t 
happen immediately though and they did not have a software for tracking the customer’s requests. This was the main reason to develop an 
application which is a software which helps in tracking the customer’s issues and resolving and reporting them.

In this technological era, modernization is needed which requires the changes all the time and has become a part of common life. Today 
many people wish to keep their life comfortable by having applications with all the features needed under one hood. They do not want to 
worry about whether the issue is being resolved or not. They want the applications to be advantageous with options like flexibility, speed
and simplicity. The tracking tickets are common now-a-days and it will be better if the trouble tickets are tracked, resolved and reported 
in one go. By this application, it will be possible to track, resolve and report issues under one roof. This is another reason to select
this as my project.


The process module of the application which is given above gives a visual representation of the application functioning. It describes the following:

• Requesting for a ticket: The user who has network issues or system problems, will have to request for a ticket so that the issue could
be resolved.
• Ticket Submission: Then the ticket will be submitted to the system by the user describing what the problem is.
• Ticket assignment: The ticket will be assigned to the user who requests for one. This will be done by automatically or can be done by 
the admin.
• Transferring the ticket to the technician: The ticket will be forwarded to the technician who will have to resolve the issue.
• Resolving the issue: The technician will resolve the issue.
• Reporting the issue: The technician will report the issue if it is resolved and keeps the status of the issue updated.
• Closing the ticket: If the issue has been totally resolved, then the user will get a message that the ticket has been closed.



I wanted this application to be user-friendly with various controls. There are features like prioritizing the work flow, transparency 
in the system etc. So, to work on the project without any difficulties I followed these steps.

• Initially, I defined all the core functionalities of the application, which means listing out all the things the application should 
be able to do. For example, this application’s core functionalities are to allow users to register and login, technician login, problem
resolution, report generation etc.
• I studied about the web technology methodologies and Object Oriented Programing concepts and how to implement them.
• I then gathered all the requirements as in installed all the required tools and software’s.
• Designed how the application should look like.
• Then I started coding for the application development. For the front-end I have used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. Back-end coding
was done in C# .NET.
• Simultaneously, I was working on the database design and the database connections.
• Testing was bit easy as I was using Visual Studio, which helps in fixing the errors immediately while coding.
